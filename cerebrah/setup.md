At runtime, convert a SHA512 encrypted text file containing a single string in to json format.  
1. Start program
2. Decrypt and open text file
3. Convert to json  

---

After conversion the text file will instead be a json ready for manipulation such as:
- Viewing objects
- Changing object data
- Removing objects
---

Requirements: 
- Encryption/decryption encapsulation --> storing passphrases, source code etc.
- Automatic backups
- Simple query system
